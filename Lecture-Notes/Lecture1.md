## What is object oriented programming?

Object-oriented programing is not actually programming. It is the way you organize your software design around your data.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

Simplify, organize, reuse and inheritance.

## What are the main principles of OOP?

In object-oriented programming there are four basic concepts. It is data abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance. 

## Encapsulation

When coding a really long script for a program, there will be an amount of moving parts that the programmer needs to have under control. Encapsulation is a group of members and properties under an object or one simply class. By effetely using encapsulation principle, the risk of losing control under developing become less. 

## Abstraction

Abstraction is considered a input parameter. It allows you to develop programs by just knowing wgat method to call and what parameter to use. 

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the definition of inheritance from other classes or objects. By simply inheritance from other classes or objects, the programing job becomes less repetitive.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is overloading a function or described, making a function that can perform on many different ways.
