OOA: analysis introduces new concepts to investigate a problem.
-	The information domain is modeled.
-	Behavior is represented.
-	The function is described
-	Data, functional, and behavior models are divided to uncover greater detail.
-	Early models represent the essence of the problem, while later ones provide      
    implementation. 

UML: Unified Modeling language is standardized modeling language enabling developers to specify, visualize, construct and document artifact of a software system. It is not a programming language but can be used to write programs.  It is developed in an effort to simplify and consolidate the large number of object-oriented development method that had emerged. 

The benefit of UML is for a quicker understanding, simplify complex system, system handover, communicate design decisions and independent of technology used.

The types of UML designed that we have is:

Structural UML diagrams
-	Class diagram
-	Object diagram
-	Component diagram
-	Composite structure diagram
-	Deployment diagram
-	Profile diagram

Behavioral UML Diagrams
-	Use diagram
-	Activity diagram
-	Sequence diagram
-	State diagram
-	Communication diagram
-	Interaction overview diagram
-	Timing diagram
