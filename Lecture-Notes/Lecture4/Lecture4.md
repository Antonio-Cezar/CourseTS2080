Case diagrams

This is for summarizing. The purpose of a use case is to define a piece of coherent behavior without relieving the internal structure of the object.

It can help visualizing the functional requirements of a system. Further interaction can be defined as state chart diagrams.

System boundary: A system boundary defines the scope and limits of the system. It is shown as a rectangle that spans all use cases of the system.

An actor is an idealization of a role played by an external person, process or thing interacting with a system.

Use case: every business functionality is a potential use case. The use case should list the discrete business functionality specified in the problem statement

Generalization of an actor means that one actor can inherit the role of the other actor. This is for open up for more use cases that are specified to that role.

Associations I a-line between actors and a use case

Include relationship represents an invocation of one-use case by another use case. From a code perspective, it is like one function being called by another

Extend: This relationship signifies that the extended use case will be inserted in the extended use case.
